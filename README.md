# Logic-Gates
* Recursive function for enumerate all the possible input sequences for the following logic gates. Then print output of the logic gate for all the possible inputs. Number of inputs of the logic gate should be taken as user inputs.
	
	1. AND GATE
	2. OR GATE
	3. XOR GATE



	* Example

		* Number of inputs of the gate: 3

		* Gate: AND
	

	* Output:

	1. 000 > 0
	2. 001 > 0
	3. 010 > 0
	4. 011 > 0
	5. 100 > 0
	6. 101 > 0
	7. 110 > 0
	8. 111 > 1
